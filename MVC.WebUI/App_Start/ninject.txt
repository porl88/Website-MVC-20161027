USING NINJECT WITH ASP.NET MVC:

Install from Nuget:

    Ninject (base library)

Create dependency resolver that inherits from IDependencyResolver:

	public class NinjectDependencyResolver : IDependencyResolver
	{
		private IKernel kernel;

		public NinjectDependencyResolver()
		{
			kernel = new StandardKernel();
			this.AddBindings();
		}

		public object GetService(Type serviceType)
		{
			return kernel.TryGet(serviceType);
		}

		public IEnumerable<object> GetServices(Type serviceType)
		{
			return kernel.GetAll(serviceType);
		}

		private void AddBindings()
		{
		}
	}

Register Ninject depency resolver in Global.asax:

	DependencyResolver.SetResolver(new NinjectDependencyResolver());




USING NINJECT WITH WEB API:

Install from Nuget:

    Ninject (base library)
    Ninject.Web.Common
    Ninject.Web.Common.WebHost
    Ninject.Web.WebApi.WebHost ("Ninject Web Host for WebApi 2")
    Ninject.Web.WebApi ("Ninject Integration for WebApi 2")

Install Ninject.Web.WebApi and Ninject.WebApi.WebHost first as they include the other namespaces as dependencies

After you install all of those, you'll find a pre-built NinjectWebCommon class in your App_Start folder. Just add you bindings to the RegisterServices() method.

No need to register anything in Global.asax.

If you want to use both ASP.NET MVC and Web Api, you will need to use both methods at the same time.
